# Helium Mining Rewards Analysis

## Team members
### Andrew Hidalgo
### Nadia Nadir
### Krishan Kandial
### Andrew McCoy

## Project Description
### Pull data from the Helium Network using an API to analyze rewards earned for particular hotspots.

### Research Questions and project tasks
### What is the average daily reward for a given hotspot over the last 30 days?
### What is the standard deviation of daily rewards for a given hotspot over the last 30 days?
### What is the projected total rewards earned for a given hotspot over the next 30, 60, 90 days?
### What is the NPV for a given hotspot? Assume the risk free rate is a 1-year T-bill.
### In what areas of the US and/or world is it most profitable to place a hotspot?
#### Create buckets of hotspots in various areas of the world to analyze and plot on a map.



## Data sets to be used
### Helium Network data using their API (https://api.helium.io)
### CoinMarket Cap (CoinmarketCap.com)


## Task Assignments
### Andrew McCoy - pull and clean data using helium api
### Andrew Hidalgo - Write code to calculate average daily rewards and standard deviation of rewards for particular hotspot
### Nadia Nadir - Write code to make plot, charts and a map of the hotspot locations
### Krishan Kandial - Pull price data from CoinMarketCap and run Monte Carlo simulations to project rewards for a hotspot and returns of holding the HNT token.
### All - Design and create dashboard
